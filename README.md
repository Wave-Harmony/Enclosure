# Real-Time Audio Spectrum Analyzer

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a Real-Time Audio Spectrum Analyzer, housed in an enclosure made from acrylic and wood. Due to the size of the analyzer, 3D printing was not a viable option. Instead, we chose a combination of materials to ensure both durability and visual appeal.

## Enclosure Design

### Wooden Base
- **Material**: Wood
- **Purpose**: Provides a strong and rigid foundation for the spectrum analyzer.
- **Benefits**: Ensures stability and durability, supporting the structure and components securely.

### Acrylic Towers
- **Material**: Black Acrylic and Transparent Acrylic
- **Components**:
  - **Black Acrylic**: Forms the outline of the towers.
  - **Transparent Acrylic Cubes**: Lightweight and visually appealing, used to house the LEDs.
- **Assembly**:
  - The acrylic tower consists of 100 transparent acrylic cubes.
  - These cubes are held in place by a black acrylic outline and a transparent cube holder.
  - The cubes and the outline are connected together using acrylic glue.

### LED Configuration
- **Choice of LEDs**: We opted for individual LEDs driven by LED driver ICs instead of microcontrollers.
- **Reasoning**:
  - Using one-by-one LEDs allows for precise placement and drilling into the acrylic cubes.
  - This setup provides a better visual output compared to using LED strips.

## Assembly Details
- **Drilling**: Holes are drilled into the transparent acrylic cubes to accommodate the LEDs.
- **Gluing**: The components of the acrylic towers are glued together using acrylic glue for a secure and seamless finish.

## Dimensions
The dimensions of the acrylic tower are shown in the accompanying picture (include a reference to the picture file here).

## Conclusion
This design ensures a robust and visually appealing enclosure for the Real-Time Audio Spectrum Analyzer, leveraging the strengths of both wood and acrylic materials. The choice of individual LEDs driven by LED driver ICs provides a superior visual output for spectrum visualization.
